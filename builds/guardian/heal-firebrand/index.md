<Warning> 

This build is very common in PuGs. More information about building effective team compositions can be found [here](/guides/effective-comp). This build provides a high number of boons and a lot of safety to the group via its healing. It, therefore, shines most in less experienced groups as well as when you have bad instabilities. Once the safety of a dedicated healer is no longer needed, you can move on to running [Power Firebrand](/builds/guardian/power-firebrand) or [Condi. Firebrand](/builds/guardian/condi-firebrand). We also added a new heal variant that is in between the full heal and damage version called [Celestial Firebrand](/builds/guardian/celestial-firebrand) for parties wanting to transition to no heal runs.
 
</Warning>

The <Specialization name="Firebrand" text="Heal Firebrand" /> provides a good amount of <Boon name="Might" />, permanent <Boon name="Quickness" />, <Boon name="Fury" />, <Boon name="Regeneration" /> and <Boon name="Swiftness" /> as well as some <Boon name="Protection" /> and <Boon name="Resolution" />. It also has on-demand access to <Boon name="Aegis" />, <Boon name="Stability" /> and <Boon name="Resistance" />.

It offers a decent amount of healing through symbols, dodges, <Skill name="Mantra of Solace"/>, <Boon name="Regeneration"/>, <Skill name="Bow of Truth"/>, etc.

The build is very flexible and can be adapted to the encounter, instabilities, and the group you are playing with. Make sure to read through the situational tab for an explanation of the different utility skills. The [CM Guides](/cm-guides/guardian/heal-firebrand/) will also give an overview of what you can run on different encounters.

### Axe/Shield

- <Skill name="Core Cleave" /> does decent damage even as a healer.
- <Skill name="Symbol of Vengeance" /> places a symbol that will pulse <Boon name="Fury" />
  . Due to <Trait name="Writ of Persistence" /> this will also passively heal allies
  within. This skill should be used off cooldown when on the Axe weapon set.
- <Skill name="Blazing Edge" /> can be used for CC or to pull adds together.
- <Skill name="Shield of Judgment" /> grants <Boon name="Protection" /> and <Boon name="Aegis" />
  . This is a main source of on-demand <Boon name="Aegis" /> and adds some extra <Boon name="Protection"/> on top of what you get from <Skill name="Mantra of Solace"/>.
- <Skill name="Shield of Absorption" /> is very versatile. This skill can be double-tapped
  for quick CC or healing or can be channeled longer for negating projectiles. This
  skill will cancel other skills you are currently casting.

</GridItem>

<GridItem sm="6">
### Staff

- <Skill name="Bolt of Wrath" /> is rather weak but can be used to aggro enemies
  from range.
- <Skill name="Holy Strike" /> can be used to heal, aggro adds from range or to blast <Boon name="Might" /> or
  condi cleanse.
- <Skill name="Symbol of Swiftness" /> places a symbol that will pulse <Boon name="Swiftness" />
  . Due to <Trait name="Writ of Persistence" /> this will also passively heal allies
  within. This skill should be used off-cooldown when on the Staff weapon set.
- <Skill name="Empower" /> is one of your main sources of <Boon name="Might" /> and
  should be used off-cooldown while on Staff. You can give yourself <Boon name="Aegis" /> while
  channeling via <Skill name="Advance"/> for incoming attacks if you are using this skill.
- <Skill name="Line of Warding" /> is a very niche skill. This skill will cancel
  other skills you are currently casting.

### Mace

- <Skill name="True Strike" /> does decent damage and heals when finishing the auto-attack
  chain.
- <Skill name="Symbol of Faith" /> places a symbol that will pulse <Boon name="Regeneration" />
  . Due to <Trait name="Writ of Persistence" /> this will also passively heal allies
  within. This skill should be used off-cooldown when on the Mace weapon set.
- <Skill name="Protectors Strike" /> grants <Boon name="Aegis" /> if you block an
  attack while channeling it. It can sometimes be useful to run into an attack on
  purpose while channeling this attack to trigger the <Boon name="Aegis" /> application.

### Tomes

Activating a Tome will replace your weapon skills and grant you 5 skill usages in the Tome. You can also leave the Tome early though.

Entering a Tome has a cast time and your Skill 5 on both weapon sets can cancel skill casts so make sure to not spam the 5 buttons when entering the Tome or you might end up canceling the Tome.

Tomes also have the passive effect from the Virtues. Through <Trait name="Loremaster"/> those passive effects will be kept even if the Tomes are on cooldown.

All Tomes are built similarly:

- Skill 1 creates an effect in a cone in front of you.
- Skill 2 creates an effect around you.
- Skill 3 is a ground target skill.
- Skill 4 creates a field.
- Skill 5 grants a unique buff to your allies.

<Skill name="Tome of Justice" />:

- Use this Tome mainly for providing a Fire Field.
- <Skill name="Chapter 1: Searing Spell"/> and <Skill name="Chapter 2: Igniting Burst"/> are mostly useless on <Specialization name="Firebrand" text="Heal Firebrand"/>.
- <Skill name="Chapter 3: Heated Rebuke"/> is a CC. It pulls enemies together and can be used from range.
- <Skill name="Chapter 4: Scorched Aftermath"/> creates a Fire Field that can be used to blast <Boon name="Might"/>.
- <Skill name="Epilogue: Ashes of the Just"/> grants an effect to allies that makes them inflict burning on their next attacks. This scales with <Attribute name="Condition Damage"/> so be careful when using this skill or skip it entirely when running with <Specialization name="Firebrand" text="Condi Firebrands"/>.
- When running Radiance, dealing damage with any skill in this Tome will trigger <Trait name="Wrath of Justice"/> and share the <Attribute name="Condition Damage"/> to allies through <Trait name="Perfect Inscriptions"/>.
- A common rotation in this Tome is 4-5-exit.

<Skill name="Tome of Resolve" />:

- Use this Tome for emergency healing and cleansing.
- <Skill name="Chapter 1: Desert Bloom"/> heals in a cone in front of you.
- <Skill name="Chapter 2: Radiant Recovery"/> heals and cleanses conditions.
- <Skill name="Chapter 3: Azure Sun"/> gives some boons but will rarely be used.
- <Skill name="Chapter 4: Shining River"/> places a healing field that can also be blasted for extra healing.
- <Skill name="Epilogue: Eternal Oasis"/> converts conditions into boons and grants allies an incoming healing modifier.
- When running Virtues entering this Tome also cleanses conditions.

<Skill name="Tome of Courage" />:

- Use this Tome for massive <Boon name="Stability"/>, <Boon name="Resistance"/> or a reflect.
- <Skill name="Chapter 1: Unflinching Charge"/> grants <Boon name="Stability"/>.
- <Skill name="Chapter 2: Daring Challenge"/> inflicts 1 second of <Condition name="Taunt"/> on the enemy which is a 75/s soft CC.
- <Skill name="Chapter 3: Valiant Bulwark"/> places a bubble that reflects incoming projectiles.
- <Skill name="Chapter 4: Stalwart Stand"/> places a field that pulses <Boon name="Resistance"/> to allies. This will help dealing with non-damaging conditions such as <Condition name="Blinded"/> and <Condition name="Slow"/>.
- <Skill name="Epilogue: Unbroken Lines"/> provides <Boon name="Protection"/>, <Boon name="Aegis"/>, <Boon name="Stability"/> as well as extra Toughness.
- There is no set rotation in this Tome, use whatever skills you need for their utility and make sure to press Skill 5 as it is an incredibly strong skill.


<Divider text="Providing Boons"/>
<Grid>

<GridItem sm="6">
### Standard Boons

- <Boon name="Quickness" /> will be provided by using all charges of <Skill name="Mantra of Potence" /> off cooldown. <Skill name="Mantra of Solace" /> can also be used (if playing <Trait name="Liberators Vow" />) every 7 seconds. Finally, if playing <Trait name="Stalwart Speed"/> you will also generate <Boon name="Quickness" />, when gving allies <Boon name="Aegis"/> or <Boon name="Stability"/>.
- <Boon name="Might" /> comes from different sources. <Trait name="Stoic Demeanor"/> will generate <Boon name="Might" /> when you disable (CC), or apply <Condition name="Immobile"/> or <Condition name="slow"/>. This synergises well with <Trait name="Unrelenting Criticism"/> and <Trait name="Weighty Terms"/>. <Skill name="Empower" /> is
  a big source of <Boon name="Might" /> and should be used off-cooldown whenever
  you are on Staff and on the group. Using <Skill name="Tome of Justice" /> Skill
  4 and blasting it with <Skill name="Holy Strike" /> will also grant <Boon name="Might" /> and
  give others the option to also blast additional <Boon name="Might" />. Using <Skill name="Mantra of Potence" /> as mentioned above will also contribute to <Boon name="Might" /> generation.
- <Boon name="Fury" /> will be provided through <Skill name="Symbol of Vengeance" />
  . Make sure to use this off-cooldown when on the Axe weapon set while people are
  stacked together. Try to use this skill 2 times before swapping to Staff.
- <Boon name="Swiftness" /> mainly comes from <Skill name="Symbol of Swiftness" />
  . Make sure to use this whenever you are on Staff.
- <Boon name="Regeneration" /> will be provided through <Skill name="Mantra of Lore" /> when
  equipped. You can keep 2 charges for condi cleanse while providing some <Boon name="Regeneration" /> whenever it goes back to 3 charges.
- Your main source of <Boon name="Protection"/> comes from <Skill name="Mantra of Solace"/>. You can use it whenever you need it for healing but make sure to use it often enough to trigger <Trait name="Liberator's Vow"/> for <Boon name="Quickness"/>. Some <Boon name="Protection"/> can be provided through <Skill name="Shield of Judgment"/>. <Skill name="Tome of Courage"/> offers some <Boon name="Protection"/> from Skill 5 as well but you do not want to use this Tome just for a small boost in <Boon name="Protection"/>.
- <Boon name="Resolution" /> is provided through <Skill name="Mantra of Solace" /> and <Skill name="Mantra of Liberation" />. If you think you will not need all 3 charges for <Boon name="Stability" />, you can use <Skill name="Mantra of Liberation" /> down to 2 charges in order to to keep up permanent <Boon name="Resolution" /> for the group alongside <Skill name="Mantra of Solace" />.

### Aegis

- Correct application of <Boon name="Aegis"/> requires knowledge of the encounters and which attacks are impactful to block.
- <Skill name="Shield of Judgment" /> is your main accessible source of <Boon name="Aegis"/> unless you slot <Skill name="Advance"/>.
- <Skill name="Epilogue: Unbroken Lines"/> in <Skill name="Tome of Courage" /> will also provide <Boon name="Aegis" />. You do not want to enter this Tome only for the single application of <Boon name="Aegis" />, but it si nice to keep in mind when deciding whether to do into the Tome.
- <Skill name="Advance" /> is the only instant-cast skill providing <Boon name="Aegis" /> when chosen and can be used while casting other skills to not get interrupted.
- If Mace is equipped, <Skill name="Protectors Strike"/> also grants <Boon name="Aegis"/> when blocking an attack while channeling.

</GridItem>
<GridItem sm="6">
<Card title="Pre-Stacking Boons">

- Provide a Fire Field if needed. <Skill name="Chapter 4: Scorched Aftermath"/> in <Skill name="Tome of Justice"/> provides a short Fire Field. <Skill name="Hallowed Ground"/> provides a longer Fire Field as well as extra <Boon name="Resolution"/> but has to be specifically slotted for pre-stacking.
- <Skill name="Holy Strike" /> to blast <Boon name="Might" />.
- <Skill name="Empower" /> and cast every equipped Mantra as often as you can during the cast.
- <Skill name="Feel My Wrath" /> if you have it equipped.
- Take the singularity.
- <Skill name="Empower" /> and use <Skill name="Mantra of Potence" /> once during
  this cast.
- <Skill name="Symbol of Swiftness" /> on the way to the boss and swap to Axe before
  the fight starts to place <Skill name="Symbol of Vengeance" />.

</Card>
### Stability

- Correct application of <Boon name="Stability"/> requires knowledge of the encounters and which attacks and be negated with <Boon name="Stability"/> without taking too much damage.
- Make sure to not apply too much <Boon name="Stability"/> at once. For example, if you use <Skill name="Stand Your Ground"/>, you will most likely not need to apply any more <Boon name="Stability"/> until the boon ends since it provides 5 stacks.
- <Skill name="Mantra of Liberation" /> is the easiest access to <Boon name="Stability" />. However keep in mind this only provides one stack.
- The most common utility skill choice for extra <Boon name="Stability"/> is <Skill name="Stand Your Ground"/> but when the longer cooldown of <Skill name="Hallowed Ground"/> is not an issue that one can be used very well on stationary targets.
- You can use <Skill name="Mantra of Liberation"/> and <Skill name="Stand Your Ground"/> while casting <Skill name="Empower"/> if an interrupt is incoming.
- <Skill name="Tome of Courage" /> will also grant access to a very high amount of <Boon name="Stability" /> but is on a fairly long cooldown. Make sure to open the Tome ahead of time due to both the Tome and the skills within having a cast time.
- Make sure to provide enough healing while in <Skill name="Tome of Courage"/> since it replaces your weapons skills. This can be achieved through dodges, utility skills, or pre-placed symbols.

</GridItem>
</Grid>

<Divider text="Healing"/>

### Sustained Healing

- Try to keep your group alive as well as you can through sustained healing and use your burst healing only when it is needed. Keep in mind that active damage mitigation through avoiding attacks or blocking them is very valuable and will help a lot more than a slight increase in healing numbers.
- A lot of consistent healing comes from your symbols through <Trait name="Writ of Persistence"/>. Since you want to use <Skill name="Symbol of Vengeance"/> and <Skill name="Symbol of Swiftness"/> off-cooldown anyways to provide boons, This will give you a nice amount of healing through the entire fight. Same goes for <Skill name="Empower"/>.
- Thanks to <Trait name="Selfless Daring"/> you will also heal at the end of a dodge roll. Make sure to keep enough endurance to avoid mechanics but otherwise feel free to use up dodges for healing.
- If <Skill name="Mantra of Lore"/> is equipped, it will provide <Boon name="Regeneration"/> to your group so make sure to use it down to 2 charges whenever it goes back up to 3.
- If Mace is equipped the auto-attacks will provide a good amount of healing and <Skill name="Symbol of Faith"/> will provide extra <Boon name="Regeneration"/>.

### Burst Healing

- For emergencies you have some smaller burst healing options as well
  as your <Skill name="Tome of Resolve" />.
- If you are swapping to Staff when
  healing is needed keep in mind that <Skill name="Symbol of Swiftness" />
  provides healing over time while <Skill name="Holy Strike" /> and
  <Skill name="Empower" /> provide burst healing.
- <Skill name="Bow of Truth" /> is a great option for high burst healing when slotted.
- <Skill name="Tome of Resolve" /> is the biggest source of burst healing and should
  be used as a last resort due to its long cooldown. However, due to the cast of both
  opening the Tome and the skills within, make sure to not hesitate too long.

### Condition Cleanse

- If a lot of condition cleanse is needed you will most likely slot <Skill name="Mantra of Lore"/> which will then be your main reliable source of condition cleanse while also providing some extra <Boon name="Regeneration"/>.
- Blasting Light Fields also causes area condition to cleanse. On Staff you can place <Skill name="Symbol of Swiftness"/> and blast it with <Skill name="Holy Strike"/>.
- In <Skill name="Tome of Resolve" /> <Skill name="Chapter 2: Radiant Recovery"/> and <Skill name="Epilogue: Eternal Oasis"/> will cleanse conditions as well,
  however same as with burst healing this is often a last resort. When running Virtues,
  opening this Tome will also cleanse conditions.

<Divider text="Videos"/>

<Warning>

Here's two In-Depth video guides on <Specialization name="Firebrand" text="Heal Firebrand" />. Keep in mind that these videos were made before <Skill name="Mantra of solace"/> got changed from giving <Boon name="Aegis"/> to giving <Boon name="Protection"/> and <Boon name="Resolution"/>.
